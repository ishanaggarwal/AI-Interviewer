# Demo Script - Virtual Avatar Voicebot

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Hi! I built Edith, an AI-powered virtual interview coach that helps candidates practice technical interviews with realistic voice interactions."

## Key Features (30 seconds)
"The system features a cosmic AI avatar with animated mouth movements synced to speech. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent conversations and TTS for natural voice responses. I implemented audio caching for instant replay, making interactions feel seamless and responsive."

## Interview Types (20 seconds)
"Edith conducts four interview types: Technical, Behavioral, System Design, and Coding. Each has specialized prompts tailored to that interview category."

## Coding Interview Demo (40 seconds)
"Let me show you the coding interview - my favorite feature. When you select it, Edith presents a random LeetCode problem, then follows a structured flow: First, she asks you to explain your approach. Then, she asks about time and space complexity. After that, you implement your solution in the built-in code editor. Finally, she provides detailed code review with feedback on correctness, complexity, and optimizations."

## Tech Stack (15 seconds)
"Built with vanilla JavaScript for modularity, OpenAI APIs for intelligence and speech, Web Speech Recognition for voice input, and Canvas API for the avatar rendering."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"This project demonstrates full-stack integration, API design, state management, and creating seamless AI-powered user experiences."
